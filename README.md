# WS-DETR
The WS-DETR model, proposed for real-time traffic object detection, is built upon the RT-DETR framework and incorporates two key innovations: the Wavelet-Mamba Dual Path Block (WM-Dual Block) and the Shared Query Axial Cross-Attention (SQ-ACA) mechanism. These modules enhance small-object detection and robustness in complex environments.
